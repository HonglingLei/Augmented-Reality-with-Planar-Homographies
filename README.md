# Augmented Reality with Planar Homographies
In this project, I conducted real-time image and video AR projections through interest point matching and homography estimation. The first step was to find point correspondences with the FAST detector and BRIEF descriptor. Then I estimated homography between the images using the eight-point algorithm. With the computed homography, we'd be able to warp/project an image to the targeted location.
